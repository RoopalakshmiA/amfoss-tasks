I downloaded ubuntu.I tried 2 methods but failed because my laptop wouldnt go to the boot menu even after restarting despite pressing the F12 and all kinds of fn keys. 
So then i realised there was a problem with my laptop, it was actually virus due to roblox studio because of which i could not even uninstall it so then i updated my windows again
and did by first downloading rufus again.
